# Queues

### Basic Implementation
- QueueArrayBased.cpp : uses vector<int> which wastes memory as we dequeue
- QueueArrayBasedCircular1.cpp : uses vector<int> but it's circular (implemented using size and capacity fields which is more simple)
- QueueArrayBasedCircular2.cpp : uses vector<int> but it's circular (implemented only using capacity)
- QueueLinked.java : queue implementation with linked Nodes.

### More advanced?
